						<h2 >MEDICATION-ADHERENCE TRACKING<br> smart PILL BOTTLE</h2>
						<p>We sought to address the problem of medical non-adherence, both among seniors and those with mental illness. To this end, we attached an inertial sensor along with a number of cameras to a pill bottle. We then had 5
						participants take 10 pills each. After collecting data from all devices, a number of machine learning technique were applied to predict whether or not a pill had been taken. Using a Random Forest Classifier and a Convolutional
						Neural Network, we were able to reach an accuracy of 95% and 94% on those models respectively. We also employed a state-of-the-art real time object recognition system to detect both the hands and face of anyone using the pill bottle.
						With the assumption that these two objects overlapping indicates a pill-taking moment, we were able to achieve an accuracy of 80% when classifying whether or not a pill was taken. Finally, we propose a system by
						which these models could be integrated to solve the problem of non-adherence and discuss the limitations of our work.</p>

						<h2>EYE DISEASE RECOGNITION USING DEEP LEARNING</h2>
						<p>This project sought to predict the presence of a disease and categorize it by applying deep convolutional neural networks to images of the eye. Using fundus (inside) images of the eye,
							we were able to we were able to accurately categorize whether an eye was healthy or had one of six eye related diseases.
							<br>The diseases looked at were: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
							• Myopia 	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Glaucoma &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
							<br>
							•  Cataracts  	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;• Age-related macular degeneration &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
							<br>
							• Diabetic retinopathy  	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;	• Hypertensive retinopathy &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
							<br>
							After using several popular convolutional neural networks including VGG19, AlexNet, and ResNet50, we trained models and made predictions. When classifying each class individually, we achieved an accuracy of
							80-95% depending on the disease. In a multiclass setting, we achieved an overall accuracy of 87%.
